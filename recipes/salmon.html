                <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
                <li>5 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
                <li>1 bunch fresh dill, stems trimmed</li>
                <li>1 (1 pound) salmon fillet</li>

                <li>Pour a small amount of the butter mixture into an 8x8-inch baking pan until bottom is evenly coated; cover with a thin layer of dill.
