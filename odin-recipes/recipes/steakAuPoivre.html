        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>While this may take a while to cook, it is by far my favorite dish. I have been very frustrated with ordering Steak au Poivre when dining out only to find that what I made at home was much better. Hope you enjoy it!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns, or more to taste</li>
                <li>2 (6 ounce) (1 1/4 inch thick) tenderloin steaks</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced shallot</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons cognac</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons red wine</li>
                <li>1/4 cup beef broth</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Procedure:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Crack peppercorns in a mortar or pestle or with a rolling pin. Press cracked peppercorns into the steaks.</li>
                <li>Heat butter in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add steaks; cook, turning with tongs, until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Reduce heat to medium and cook steaks, turning often, until they begin to firm up and are hot and slightly pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer steaks to a plate and cover to keep warm.</li>
                <li>Stir shallot into the skillet. Pour in cognac and red wine; simmer, stirring constantly, until reduced, about 2 minutes. Pour in beef broth and simmer, scraping browned bits off the bottom of the skillet, until sauce is smooth, about 2 minutes. Stir in cream; cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pour cream sauce over steaks.</li>
            </ol>
